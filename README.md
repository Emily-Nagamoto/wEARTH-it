# wEARTH-it
This is our HackDuke 2020 Project.
Sustainable habits are wEARTH it, not only for the planet but also for you! wEARTH it is an all new eco-conscious habit tracker with an engaging interface. Henny the Hedgehog will guide you through logging your daily habits and actions, and you will receive a score along with suggestions based on your current actions. These recommendations will help you reduce your carbon footprint and lead a more sustainable lifestyle overall. You can also access news articles and tools to be further educated on environmental matters. Challenge yourself and your friends to improve their score and compete to make it onto the leaderboard. Save money, save time, and save the planet!

Built with: 
Scratch, Figma, Scratch HTML Converter

About the project-
Inspiration:
We were inspired by our own eco-conscious daily habits. We realize it is difficult to keep track of these habits and wanted to devise a way to encourage individuals to maintain eco-friendly habits. This app seeks to do just that through an interactive and enjoyable interface. 

What it does:
wEARTH it allows users to log an action/habit, which corresponds to a point value based on the sustainability of that action. Every action logged is tallied in a daily total score which users can challenge themselves and others to improve. Users are also provided with suggestions for improving their actions. Other features include an aesthetically-pleasing and clean interface, a leaderboard, progress and trends, and notifications. 

How I built it:
Scratch, Figma, and a ton of creativity 

Challenges I ran into:
None of our team members have any substantial coding experience, so we had to be resourceful in finding tools that allowed us to create the project we envisioned. We also had difficulty converting between Scratch and other file formats like html or JavaScript.

Accomplishments I’m proud of:
Not only is this our first hackathon as a team, but none of our team members have experience with programming. We are extremely proud of the fact that we were able to produce an application that met the submission guidelines for this Hackathon.

What I learned:
This is our first hackathon, and all members of the team had little to no coding experience prior to starting. We learned how to code through Scratch, the process of converting code between languages, and how to create an app. 

What’s next for wEARTH it:
We are looking to further customize the recommendations by taking other input values into consideration, such as location, season, and other factors. We also hope to implement features including the leaderboard and challenges to incentivize environmentally-conscious behaviors.
